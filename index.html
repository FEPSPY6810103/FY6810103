    Geotechnics and Infrastructure refers to the interaction between the ground and any 
    structure that stand on it. It is a critical challenge involved in Civil Enineering, a 
    problem which is the main consideration regarding the constructions of buildings and 
    structures. These damages stretch from degrading soils to natural disasters. 
    The data and analysis collected are used to consistently construct and maintain safety
    and reliable environment. Which comes with greater importance as it ties with public 
    safety and economic stability.

    The most common type of Geotechnical and Infrastructural damages is foundation failure. 
    Caused by deciding the wrong soil to use for development or even an adequate foundation design. 
    This leadings to structural instability resulting in unstable settle and even structural collapse. 
    Due to foundation failure being so inflicting towards a structure, it has become the first 
    consideration in terms of stability in any structural design. As the impact of the foundation
    has been identified, developed foundations design have been made to solve these issues. 
    An example of this is Mat Foundation, spread flat around the ground with heavy supported columns 
    places in rows mainly in a square shape depicted in Fig. 1.The reason for the choice of design 
    is to help spread the load of the building. Regarding the weight and shape of the structure, 
    this foundation design is most suitable.

    Another common type of infrastructural damage is soil erosion, this is a gradual process caused by 
    from wind and rain. Soil particles are stripped of the material resulting in a slow but effective 
    corrosion. Due to the reason is being exposed to hash wings and water, opens an issue for bridge
    with design with contact to water. Since the process of soil erosion depends on the exposure of 
    the structure, the weighting of the damages varies vastly. A way to get around is problem is to 
    replantation, this includes vegetation with a covering of mulch. Mulch acts like an extra layer 
    of soil which even improves the fertility and health for the soil. Even though this isn’t a 
    permanent prevention, with maintenance the structural total life will be long and purposeful.

    The big consideration regarding geotechnical damages is the impact of natural disasters, more 
    specifically earthquakes. Which are more prominent in certain countries. These incidents often have 
    an impactful effect on the economic growth. Either stunting or delaying the climb, relating back to 
    the mention of economic stability being tied into geotechnics and infrastructures. What is often
    analysed after the shock of the disaster is where the highlighted parts of the building or structure
    which is in a way vulnerable. A common way to reduce the impact of earthquakes is to apply shock 
    absorbers Fig. 2. They reduce the magnitude and frequency of the vibration caused the earthquake. 
    They do this by absorbing the kinetic energy caused from the vibrations and transfer the energy 
    into thermal energy. Which is then dissipated through a hydraulic fluid. This process is irreversible. 
    Another name for this reaction is damping. To maximise the effectiveness of the dampers, the engineers
    designed to place dampers on every floor for buildings.

    An key study about Geotechnical and Infrastructural damage is the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake sequence. 
    The event resulted in 69 deaths and multiple infrastructural damages. Alongside the damages this 
    size, economical loss is inevitable. An estimated total loss of 24-46 billion US dollars. This has 
    been the greatest hit on the Kumamoto region with the previous earthquake having relatively less damage. 

    One geo-hazard that occurred was the fault movement, impact of the ground causing it to deform and effect 
    the structures depending on it. Crustal deformations reaching up to 2 meters resulting in severe damage 
    to both small homes and larger structures. Leading to liquefaction and settlement spread along rivers 
    and collecting in coastal areas. 

    As a result of the shock, landslides started to occur. First observed in the Minami Aso area, the landslide 
    mainly impacted infrastructures such as bridges and local trains being derailed. The ground movement of the
    bridge lead to forces and bending movements being induced in the piles. The pilesbeing the main support for 
    a bridge, thick solid columns. As a result, there was major damage the pilesand the interior damages shown 
    in deep cracks. This greatly increased the risk of danger when using the purpose of the bridge resulting in 
    the viability and the public safety of the structure being not applicable. To avoid such damage delt on piles
    on the bridge, a decision for a consideration for a new design was put in place. A bridge design that has a
    very effective standing against earthquakes is a suspension bridge. Firstly the main from of the bridge is 
    build form steel, which is a relatively flexible metal. This is an ideal property due to the metal moving 
    with vibrations of the earth and absorbing the shock. Within the frame, another layer of absorption in forms 
    of dampers shown in Fig. 2.

    <h3 id="Conclusion"><b>Conclusion</b></h3>

  <p class="ex1">
  <pre>
   This paper presented the multiple types of geotechnical and infrastructural damage. Throughout the research 
    into finding solutions to these problem, there has been many efficient and effective design that have successful 
    carried out its purpose. As supported by the annual number of death due to natural disasters having decreased
    greatly. Structures are still effected by the types of damages therefore approach’s a risk. This is because the 
    balance between cost and value is rather quite unpredictable, due to the fact natural disasters are unpreventable.
    Therefore damages caused from natural disasters still devastating and an issue.
